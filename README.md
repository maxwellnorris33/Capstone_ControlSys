# Capstone Control System and Simulation

A central repository containing the code created by our capstone group for control system development in Matlab Simulink and visualization within Flightgear. 
This control system was developed using the RCAM dynamic model and aerodynamic coefficients from OpenVSP and OpenFOAM simulations.
